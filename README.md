House Price Prediction üè†üí∞
Description:
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and more. By leveraging regression algorithms, this project provides a practical solution for estimating real estate prices.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights and visualizations to understand trends and correlations.
Modeling: Implementation of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests).
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤.
Prediction: Predicting house prices for new or unseen data.
Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language for the project.
Libraries:
Pandas and NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
